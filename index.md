## Who am I?
I'm strongly web oriented **full-stack software developer** and **IT trainer**. Both fascinated and terrified by technology advancement.

Sometimes scrum master, architect, team leader, speaker. TypeScript fan and promoter.

* As front-end dev I am focused on TypeScript and Angular but I and constantly exploring new frameworks and areas.
* As back-end dev I prefer Asp.net with C# or Node.js, but vary of technologies and languages went through my fingers. I used to work with WPF, Silverlight, Python and Django, Visual Basic or PHP.

I love to talk and share knowledge, also fixing your “unsolvable” git problems :)
